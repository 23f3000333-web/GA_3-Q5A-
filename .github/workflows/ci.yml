    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

```

5. Click **"Commit changes"** → **"Commit changes"** again

> **What does this do?** It tells GitHub's robot to run whenever you push code to `main`. The `workflow_dispatch` part lets you also trigger it manually. The job itself just checks out your code and prints a message — simple but enough to get a green checkmark.

## Step 3: Wait for the Workflow to Run

1. Click the **Actions** tab at the top of your repo
2. You should see your workflow running (yellow circle = in progress, green checkmark = success, red X = failed)
3. Wait about 30–60 seconds for it to finish
4. It should turn into a **green checkmark** ✅

If it fails, click on it to see the error message.

## Step 4: Get the Status Badge Markdown

1. Go to the **Actions** tab
2. Click on your workflow name ("CI") in the left sidebar
3. Click the **three dots `•••`** button in the upper right area of the page
4. Select **"Create status badge"**
5. A popup appears — just click **"Copy status badge Markdown"**

It will look like this:
```
